abstract = {The advent of digital health and artificial intelligence (AI) has promised to revolutionize clinical care, but real-world patient evaluation has yet to witness transformative changes. As history taking and physical examination continue to rely on long-established practices, a growing pipeline of AI-enhanced digital tools may soon augment the traditional clinical encounter into a data-driven process. This article presents an evidence-backed vision of how promising AI applications may enhance traditional practices, streamlining tedious tasks while elevating diverse data sources, including AI-enabled stethoscopes, cameras, and wearable sensors, to platforms for personalized medicine and efficient care delivery. Through the lens of traditional patient evaluation, we illustrate how digital technologies may soon be interwoven into routine clinical workflows, introducing a novel paradigm of longitudinal monitoring. Finally, we provide a skeptic's view on the practical, ethical, and regulatory challenges that limit the uptake of such technologies.},

abstract = {Digital twins, which are in silico replications of an individual and its environment, have advanced clinical decision-making and prognostication in cardiovascular medicine. The technology enables personalized simulations of clinical scenarios, prediction of disease risk, and strategies for clinical trial augmentation. Current applications of cardiovascular digital twins have integrated multi-modal data into mechanistic and statistical models to build physiologically accurate cardiac replicas to enhance disease phenotyping, enrich diagnostic workflows, and optimize procedural planning. Digital twin technology is rapidly evolving in the setting of newly available data modalities and advances in generative artificial intelligence, enabling dynamic and comprehensive simulations unique to an individual. These twins fuse physiologic, environmental, and healthcare data into machine learning and generative models to build real-time patient predictions that can model interactions with the clinical environment to accelerate personalized patient care. This review summarizes digital twins in cardiovascular medicine and their potential future applications by incorporating new personalized data modalities. It examines the technical advances in deep learning and generative artificial intelligence that broaden the scope and predictive power of digital twins. Finally, it highlights the individual and societal challenges as well as ethical considerations that are essential to realizing the future vision of incorporating cardiology digital twins into personalized cardiovascular care.},
