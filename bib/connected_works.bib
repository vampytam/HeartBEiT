url = {https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c599e16c4700374913e86e2e60bea2c2fa6f26c},
abstract = {BACKGROUND
Substantial effort has been directed toward demonstrating uses of predictive models in health care. However, implementation of these models into clinical practice may influence patient outcomes, which in turn are captured in electronic health record data. As a result, deployed models may affect the predictive ability of current and future models.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate changes in predictive model performance with use through 3 common scenarios: model retraining, sequentially implementing 1 model after another, and intervening in response to a model when 2 are simultaneously implemented.


DESIGN
Simulation of model implementation and use in critical care settings at various levels of intervention effectiveness and clinician adherence. Models were either trained or retrained after simulated implementation.


SETTING
Admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Mount Sinai Health System (New York, New York) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, Massachusetts).


PATIENTS
130 000 critical care admissions across both health systems.


INTERVENTION
Across 3 scenarios, interventions were simulated at varying levels of clinician adherence and effectiveness.


MEASUREMENTS
Statistical measures of performance, including threshold-independent (area under the curve) and threshold-dependent measures.


RESULTS
At fixed 90% sensitivity, in scenario 1 a mortality prediction model lost 9% to 39% specificity after retraining once and in scenario 2 a mortality prediction model lost 8% to 15% specificity when created after the implementation of an acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction model; in scenario 3, models for AKI and mortality prediction implemented simultaneously, each led to reduced effective accuracy of the other by 1% to 28%.


LIMITATIONS
In real-world practice, the effectiveness of and adherence to model-based recommendations are rarely known in advance. Only binary classifiers for tabular ICU admissions data were simulated.


CONCLUSION
In simulated ICU settings, a universally effective model-updating approach for maintaining model performance does not seem to exist. Model use may have to be recorded to maintain viability of predictive modeling.

abstract = {Background: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects 1 in every 200 individuals and is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. HCM can be identified using an electrocardiogram (ECG) raw voltage data and deep learning approaches, but their point-of-care application is limited by the inaccessibility of these signal data. We developed a deep learning-based approach that overcomes this limitation and detects HCM from images of 12-lead ECGs across layouts. Methods: We identified ECGs from patients with HCM features present on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) or those within 30 days of an echocardiogram documenting thickened interventricular septum (end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness > 15mm). Patients with CMR-confirmed HCM were considered as cases during the final model evaluation. The model was validated within clinical settings at YNHH and externally on ECG images from the prospective, population-based UK Biobank cohort. We localized class-discriminating signals in ECG images using gradient-weighted class activation mapping. Results: Overall, 124,553 ECGs from 66,987 individuals (HCM cases and controls) were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination for HCM across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROC] 0.96) and external sets of ECG images from UK Biobank (AUROC 0.94). A positive screen for HCM was associated with a 100-fold higher odds of CMR-confirmed HCM (OR 102.4, 95% Confidence Interval, 57.4 - 182.6) in the held-out set. Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and lateral leads (V4-V5). Conclusions: We developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies HCM from ECG images with excellent discrimination. This approach represents an automated, efficient, and accessible screening strategy for HCM.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have well-documented cardioprotective effects but are underused, partly because of high cost. We aimed to develop a machine learning-based decision support tool to individualize the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) benefit of canagliflozin in type 2 diabetes.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We constructed a topological representation of the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) using 75 baseline variables collected from 4,327 patients with type 2 diabetes randomly assigned 1:1:1 to one of two canagliflozin doses (n = 2,886) or placebo (n = 1,441). Within each patient's 5% neighborhood, we calculated age- and sex-adjusted risk estimates for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). An extreme gradient boosting algorithm was trained to predict the personalized ASCVD effect of canagliflozin using features most predictive of topological benefit. For validation, this algorithm was applied to the CANVAS-Renal (CANVAS-R) trial, comprising 5,808 patients with type 2 diabetes randomly assigned 1:1 to canagliflozin or placebo.


RESULTS
In CANVAS (mean age 60.9 ± 8.1 years; 33.9% women), 1,605 (37.1%) patients had a neighborhood hazard ratio (HR) more protective than the effect estimate of 0.86 reported for MACEs in the original trial. A 15-variable tool, INSIGHT, trained to predict the personalized ASCVD effects of canagliflozin in CANVAS, was tested in CANVAS-R (mean age 62.4 ± 8.4 years; 2,164 [37.3%] women), where it identified patient phenotypes with greater ASCVD canagliflozin effects (adjusted HR 0.60 [95% CI 0.41-0.89] vs. 0.99 [95% CI 0.76-1.29]; Pinteraction = 0.04).


CONCLUSIONS
We present an evidence-based, machine learning-guided algorithm to personalize the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with type 2 diabetes for ASCVD effects.},

abstract = {AIMS
Coronary artery disease is frequently diagnosed following evaluation of stable chest pain with anatomical or functional testing. A more granular understanding of patient phenotypes that benefit from either strategy may enable personalized testing.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Using participant-level data from 9572 patients undergoing anatomical (n = 4734) vs. functional (n = 4838) testing in the PROMISE (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial, we created a topological representation of the study population based on 57 pre-randomization variables. Within each patient's 5% topological neighbourhood, Cox regression models provided individual patient-centred hazard ratios for major adverse cardiovascular events and revealed marked heterogeneity across the phenomap [median 1.11 (10th to 90th percentile: 0.52-2.61]), suggestive of distinct phenotypic neighbourhoods favouring anatomical or functional testing. Based on this risk phenomap, we employed an extreme gradient boosting algorithm in 80% of the PROMISE population to predict the personalized benefit of anatomical vs. functional testing using 12 model-derived, routinely collected variables and created a decision support tool named ASSIST (Anatomical vs. Stress teSting decIsion Support Tool). In both the remaining 20% of PROMISE and an external validation set consisting of patients from SCOT-HEART (Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART Trial) undergoing anatomical-first vs. functional-first assessment, the testing strategy recommended by ASSIST was associated with a significantly lower incidence of each study's primary endpoint (P = 0.0024 and P = 0.0321 for interaction, respectively), as well as a harmonized endpoint of all-cause mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction (P = 0.0309 and P < 0.0001 for interaction, respectively).


CONCLUSION
We propose a novel phenomapping-derived decision support tool to standardize the selection of anatomical vs. functional testing in the evaluation of stable chest pain, validated in two large and geographically diverse clinical trial populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is associated with a >8-fold increased risk of heart failure and a 2-fold risk of premature death. The use of ECG signals in screening for LV systolic dysfunction is limited by their availability to clinicians. We developed a novel deep learning–based approach that can use ECG images for the screening of LV systolic dysfunction. METHODS: Using 12-lead ECGs plotted in multiple different formats, and corresponding echocardiographic data recorded within 15 days from the Yale New Haven Hospital between 2015 and 2021, we developed a convolutional neural network algorithm to detect an LV ejection fraction <40%. The model was validated within clinical settings at Yale New Haven Hospital and externally on ECG images from Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA; Lake Regional Hospital in Osage Beach, MO; Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital in Houston, TX; and Methodist Cardiology Clinic of San Antonio, TX. In addition, it was validated in the prospective Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to localize class-discriminating signals on ECG images. RESULTS: Overall, 385 601 ECGs with paired echocardiograms were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROCs], 0.91; area under precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.55); and external sets of ECG images from Cedars Sinai (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.53), outpatient Yale New Haven Hospital clinics (AUROC, 0.94 and AUPRC, 0.77), Lake Regional Hospital (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.88), Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital (AUROC, 0.91 and AUPRC 0.88), Methodist Cardiology Clinic (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.74), and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health cohort (AUROC, 0.95 and AUPRC, 0.45). An ECG suggestive of LV systolic dysfunction portended >27-fold higher odds of LV systolic dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram (odds ratio, 27.5 [95% CI, 22.3–33.9] in the held-out set). Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and anteroseptal leads (V2 and V3), corresponding to the left ventricle regardless of the ECG layout. A positive ECG screen in individuals with an LV ejection fraction ≥40% at the time of initial assessment was associated with a 3.9-fold increased risk of developing incident LV systolic dysfunction in the future (hazard ratio, 3.9 [95% CI, 3.3–4.7]; median follow-up, 3.2 years). CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies LV systolic dysfunction from ECG images. This approach represents an automated and accessible screening strategy for LV systolic dysfunction, particularly in low-resource settings.},

abstract = {Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) events is significant for early clinical diagnosis and appropriate intervention. However, in existing detection algorithms for paroxysmal AF (AFp), the location of AF starting and ending points in AFp is not concerned. To achieve an accurate identification of AFp events in the long-term dynamic electrocardiograms (ECGs), this paper proposes a two-step method based on machine learning. In the first step, based on features extracted from the calculated R-to-R intervals (RR intervals, the cycle of heart beat), the rhythm type of the ECG signal is first classified into three classes (AFp rhythm, persistent AF (AFf) rhythm, and non-atrial fibrillation (non-AF, N) rhythm) using support vector machine (SVM). In the second step, the starting and ending points for AF episodes of AFp rhythms predicted in the first step are further located based on heartbeat classification. By training a deep convolutional neural network with phased training, the segmented beats of AFp rhythms are divided into AF beats and non-AF beats to determine the beginning and end of any AF episode. The proposed two-step method is trained and tested on the 4th China Physiological Signal Challenge 2021 databases. A final score U of 1.9310 is obtained on the unpublished test set maintained by the challenge organizers, which demonstrates the advantage of the two-step method in AFp event detection. The work is useful for assessing AF burden index for AFp patients.},

abstract = {Background: Novel targeted treatments increase the need for prompt hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) detection. However, its low prevalence (0.5%) and resemblance to common diseases present challenges that may benefit from automated machine learning–based approaches. We aimed to develop machine learning models to detect HCM and to differentiate it from other cardiac conditions using ECGs and echocardiograms, with robust generalizability across multiple cohorts. Methods: Single-institution HCM ECG models were trained and validated on external data. Multi-institution models for ECG and echocardiogram were trained on data from 3 academic medical centers in the United States and Japan using a federated learning approach, which enables training on distributed data without data sharing. Models were validated on held-out test sets for each institution and from a fourth academic medical center and were further evaluated for discrimination of HCM from aortic stenosis, hypertension, and cardiac amyloidosis. Last, automated detection was compared with manual interpretation by 3 cardiologists on a data set with a realistic HCM prevalence. Results: We identified 74 376 ECGs for 56 129 patients and 8392 echocardiograms for 6825 patients at the 4 academic medical centers. Although ECG models trained on data from each institution displayed excellent discrimination of HCM on internal test data (C statistics, 0.88–0.93), the generalizability was limited, most notably for a model trained in Japan and tested in the United States (C statistic, 0.79–0.82). When trained in a federated manner, discrimination of HCM was excellent across all institutions (C statistics, 0.90–0.96 and 0.90–0.96 for ECG and echocardiogram model, respectively), including for phenotypic subgroups. The models further discriminated HCM from hypertension, aortic stenosis, and cardiac amyloidosis (C statistics, 0.84, 0.83, and 0.88, respectively, for ECG and 0.93, 0.94, 0.85, respectively, for echocardiogram). Analysis of electrocardiography-echocardiography paired data from 11 823 patients from an external institution indicated a higher sensitivity of automated HCM detection at a given positive predictive value compared with cardiologists (0.98 versus 0.81 at a positive predictive value of 0.01 for ECG and 0.78 versus 0.59 at a positive predictive value of 0.24 for echocardiogram). Conclusions: Federated learning improved the generalizability of models that use ECGs and echocardiograms to detect and differentiate HCM from other causes of hypertrophy compared with training within a single institution.},

abstract = {Background Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most common noninvasive diagnostic tools that can provide useful information regarding a patient’s health status. Deep learning (DL) is an area of intense exploration that leads the way in most attempts to create powerful diagnostic models based on physiological signals. Objective This study aimed to provide a systematic review of DL methods applied to ECG data for various clinical applications. Methods The PubMed search engine was systematically searched by combining “deep learning” and keywords such as “ecg,” “ekg,” “electrocardiogram,” “electrocardiography,” and “electrocardiology.” Irrelevant articles were excluded from the study after screening titles and abstracts, and the remaining articles were further reviewed. The reasons for article exclusion were manuscripts written in any language other than English, absence of ECG data or DL methods involved in the study, and absence of a quantitative evaluation of the proposed approaches. Results We identified 230 relevant articles published between January 2020 and December 2021 and grouped them into 6 distinct medical applications, namely, blood pressure estimation, cardiovascular disease diagnosis, ECG analysis, biometric recognition, sleep analysis, and other clinical analyses. We provide a complete account of the state-of-the-art DL strategies per the field of application, as well as major ECG data sources. We also present open research problems, such as the lack of attempts to address the issue of blood pressure variability in training data sets, and point out potential gaps in the design and implementation of DL models. Conclusions We expect that this review will provide insights into state-of-the-art DL methods applied to ECG data and point to future directions for research on DL to create robust models that can assist medical experts in clinical decision-making.},

abstract = {Objective To assess the uptake of second line antihyperglycaemic drugs among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are receiving metformin. Design Federated pharmacoepidemiological evaluation in LEGEND-T2DM. Setting 10 US and seven non-US electronic health record and administrative claims databases in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network in eight countries from 2011 to the end of 2021. Participants 4.8 million patients (≥18 years) across US and non-US based databases with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had received metformin monotherapy and had initiated second line treatments. Exposure The exposure used to evaluate each database was calendar year trends, with the years in the study that were specific to each cohort. Main outcomes measures The outcome was the incidence of second line antihyperglycaemic drug use (ie, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sulfonylureas) among individuals who were already receiving treatment with metformin. The relative drug class level uptake across cardiovascular risk groups was also evaluated. Results 4.6 million patients were identified in US databases, 61 382 from Spain, 32 442 from Germany, 25 173 from the UK, 13 270 from France, 5580 from Scotland, 4614 from Hong Kong, and 2322 from Australia. During 2011-21, the combined proportional initiation of the cardioprotective antihyperglycaemic drugs (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) increased across all data sources, with the combined initiation of these drugs as second line drugs in 2021 ranging from 35.2% to 68.2% in the US databases, 15.4% in France, 34.7% in Spain, 50.1% in Germany, and 54.8% in Scotland. From 2016 to 2021, in some US and non-US databases, uptake of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors increased more significantly among populations with no cardiovascular disease compared with patients with established cardiovascular disease. No data source provided evidence of a greater increase in the uptake of these two drug classes in populations with cardiovascular disease compared with no cardiovascular disease. Conclusions Despite the increase in overall uptake of cardioprotective antihyperglycaemic drugs as second line treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus, their uptake was lower in patients with cardiovascular disease than in people with no cardiovascular disease over the past decade. A strategy is needed to ensure that medication use is concordant with guideline recommendations to improve outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {© Journal of Medical Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved. J Med Artif Intell 2021;4:6 | https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/jmai-21-12 Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia that can cause adverse events such as stroke, is a major clinical challenge. Due to its often asymptomatic and paroxysmal nature, AF is easily missed on single electrocardiograms (ECGs), making outpatient screening challenging. As a result, patients may not receive a timely diagnosis, with up to 5% of all AF cases being diagnosed at the time of stroke (1). Various machine learning (ML) models, primarily involving supervised ML methods, have been developed with the hopes of bringing an effective population screening tool to the forefront. While these models show strong performance in their respective studies, data regarding their effectiveness across racial groups is lacking. Therefore, using ML for AF screening requires two important considerations: (I) any biases in the training set data will be perpetuated in the predictions that the models offer; (II) AF has a known racial paradox, where traditional risk factors that were derived from a largely Caucasian population have a weaker correlation with AF incidence in Black patients. Below, we elaborate on these points and argue that while ML presents a unique opportunity to increase the detection of AF, it also deserves special caution to avoid reinforcing existing healthcare disparities. ML AF screening tools are commonly developed using ECG data about p-waves, R-R intervals, heart rate, and other parameters. While this has shown the ability to produce strong predictive models, the actual data sources deserve scrutiny (2). A recently published systematic review identified that while more than 100 publications exist using ECG data to develop ML models, more than half of them used the same four open-access ECG databases (3). In theory, this is not necessarily problematic, and it is understandable that so many studies reuse well known and freely available datasets. Ideally, however, the datasets would report a sufficient level of patient diversity to well represent the entire US population. Instead, many of the most commonly used ECG datasets only report limited demographic data, including the patient’s age, gender, and/or baseline clinical characteristics, without reporting racial or ethnic background. Considering the known racial differences that exist in several baseline ECG parameters, including left ventricular hypertrophy, right axis deviation, bundle branch blocks, and others, transparency about racial demographic information in these datasets is critical (4). Table 1 summarizes the most commonly used ECG databases, as well as the readily available demographic information provided by each. The reuse of these datasets carries particular concern in the diagnosis of AF, a disease with a known “racial paradox”. This paradox refers to the fact that while Black patients have a higher burden of AF risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and others, they paradoxically have a lower incidence of AF (5). Many explanations for this paradox have been proposed, including underdiagnosis of AF in Black patients due to lower healthcare access, regional genetic variations, or an unequal influence of certain risk factors between racial groups (6-8). In either case, the presence of this paradox makes data transparency in AF an even greater priority. In the same way that traditional risk factors for AF showed worse correlations with incidence in Black patients, we may now be developing ML models with the same shortcomings. One solution is for hospital systems to develop AF models using their own internal databases. The Mayo Letter to the Editor},

abstract = {Despite their immense success in numerous fields, machine and deep learning systems have not yet been able to firmly establish themselves in mission-critical applications in healthcare. One of the main reasons lies in the fact that when models are presented with previously unseen, Out-of-Distribution samples, their performance deteriorates significantly. This is known as the Domain Generalization (DG) problem. Our objective in this work is to propose a benchmark for evaluating DG algorithms, in addition to introducing a novel architecture for tackling DG in biosignal classification. In this article, we describe the Domain Generalization problem for biosignals, focusing on electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) and propose and implement an open-source biosignal DG evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, we adapt state-of-the-art DG algorithms from computer vision to the problem of 1D biosignal classification and evaluate their effectiveness. Finally, we also introduce a novel neural network architecture that leverages multi-layer representations for improved model generalizability. By implementing the above DG setup we are able to experimentally demonstrate the presence of the DG problem in ECG and EEG datasets. In addition, our proposed model demonstrates improved effectiveness compared to the baseline algorithms, exceeding the state-of-the-art in both datasets. Recognizing the significance of the distribution shift present in biosignal datasets, the presented benchmark aims at urging further research into the field of biomedical DG by simplifying the evaluation process of proposed algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at developing an open-source framework for evaluating ECG and EEG DG algorithms.},

abstract = {Determining the etiology of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be challenging due to the similarity in clinical presentation and cardiac morphological features of diverse causes of disease. In particular, distinguishing individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) from the much larger set of individuals with manifest or occult hypertension (HTN) is of major importance for family screening and the prevention of sudden death. We hypothesized that deep learning based joint interpretation of 12 lead electrocardiograms and echocardiogram videos could augment physician interpretation. We chose not to train on proximate data labels such as physician over-reads of ECGs or echocardiograms but instead took advantage of electronic health record derived clinical blood pressure measurements and diagnostic consensus (often including molecular testing) among physicians in an HCM center of excellence. Using over 18,000 combined instances of electrocardiograms and echocardiograms from 2,728 patients, we developed LVH-Fusion. On held-out test data, LVH-Fusion achieved an F1-score of 0.71 in predicting HCM, and 0.96 in predicting HTN. In head-to-head comparison with human readers LVH-Fusion had higher sensitivity and specificity rates than its human counterparts. Finally, we use explainability techniques to investigate local and global features that positively and negatively impact LVH-Fusion prediction estimates providing confirmation from unsupervised analysis the diagnostic power of lateral T wave inversion on the ECG and proximal septal hypertrophy on the echocardiogram for HCM. In conclusion, these results show that deep learning can provide effective physician augmentation in the face of a common diagnostic dilemma with far reaching implications for the prevention of sudden cardiac death.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: Given the psychosocial and ethical burden, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMs) could benefit from the establishment of genetic probability prior to the test. This study aimed to develop a simple tool to provide genotype prediction for HCMs. Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was built with the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) of 124 HCMs who underwent genetic testing (GT), externally tested by predicting the genotype on another HCMs cohort (n = 54), and compared with the conventional methods (the Mayo and Toronto score). Using a third cohort of HCMs (n = 76), the role of the network in risk stratification was explored by calculating the sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk scorers (HCM risk-SCD) across the predicted genotypes. Score-CAM was employed to provide a visual explanation of the network. Results: Overall, 80 of 178 HCMs (45%) were genotype-positive. Using the 12-lead ECG as input, the network showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83–0.96) on the test set, outperforming the Mayo score (0.69 [95% CI, 0.65–0.78], p < 0.001) and the Toronto score (0.69 [95% CI, 0.64–0.75], p < 0.001). The network classified the third cohort into two groups (predicted genotype-negative vs. predicted genotype-positive). Compared with the former, patients predicted genotype-positive had a significantly higher HCM risk-SCD (0.04 ± 0.03 vs. 0.03 ± 0.02, p <0.01). Visualization indicated that the prediction was heavily influenced by the limb lead. Conclusions: The network demonstrated a promising ability in genotype prediction and risk assessment in HCM. Key messages Patients with genotype-positive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have a higher risk of severe heart failure and sudden cardiac death (SCD). A deep learning-derived 12-lead electrocardiogram was developed, outperformed the conventional methods in genotype prediction, and showed a promising future in SCD risk assessment in HCM.},

abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in clinical applications. With the advent of advanced algorithms, various deep learning models have been adopted for ECG tasks. However, the potential of Transformer for ECG data has not been fully realized, despite their widespread success in computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, we present Masked Transformer for ECG classification (MTECG), a simple yet effective method which significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art algorithms in ECG classification. Our approach adapts the image-based masked autoencoders to self-supervised representation learning from ECG time series. We utilize a lightweight Transformer for the encoder and a 1-layer Transformer for the decoder. The ECG signal is split into a sequence of non-overlapping segments along the time dimension, and learnable positional embeddings are added to preserve the sequential information. We construct the Fuwai dataset comprising 220,251 ECG recordings with a broad range of diagnoses, annotated by medical experts, to explore the potential of Transformer. A strong pre-training and fine-tuning recipe is proposed from the empirical study. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method increases the macro F1 scores by 3.4%-27.5% on the Fuwai dataset, 9.9%-32.0% on the PTB-XL dataset, and 9.4%-39.1% on a multicenter dataset, compared to the alternative methods. We hope that this study could direct future research on the application of Transformer to more ECG tasks.},

Manual tumor identification by physicians is labor-intensive and demands high level of focus. To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning model for automated tumor detection. Our model employs a streamlined version of the U-Net Transformer (UNETR), where the original transformer layers are replaced by Squeeze and Excitation (SE) layers for more efficient computation. This modification improves the Dice score for tumor segmentation and enhances the ability to distinguish between organ and tumor pixels. Furthermore, we establish that concurrent segmentation of both the organ and the tumor significantly improves the overall performance in tumor segmentation tasks. To evaluate this claim, we trained the model using two types of datasets: one containing both organ and tumor information, and another containing only tumor information. The former approach yielded more accurate tumor localization, while the latter proved ineffective due to the absence of organ context. Our findings suggest that incorporating organ information significantly improves the training and prediction accuracy for tumor segmentation.},

abstract = {Indeed, initially, HCM was a disease for which management was based largely on pharmacotherapy (eg, betablockers; verapamil), as well as infrequent highrisk surgical procedures.4 However, predominantly nonpharmacologic innovations over the last 20 to 25 years have dramatically adjusted patient expectations for longevity and good quality of life, including reversibility of heart failure with surgical myectomy (and its selective alternative alcohol septal ablation).3,5,6 In the present commentary we discuss the effective treatment modalities currently available for HCMrelated heart failure due to left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction, anticipating the emergence of new medications for symptomatic patients, and the role such therapies may have with respect particularly to timehonored surgical myectomy.},

abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an under-recognized disease with a genetic component that results in abnormal and often asymmetric thickening of the left ventricle in addition to decreased compliance and progressive fibrosis of the myocardium. It further poses significant complications related to dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction over time in a significant majority. The medical management of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has evolved over the decades as our understanding has grown. Traditionally, the mainstay in management has included the use of various negative inotropic agents. In contrast, the cardiac myosin inhibitors, aficamten and mavacamten, are novel therapies targeting cardiac contractility at the sarcomere level that have demonstrated improvement in clinical outcomes for patients, and mavacamten (Bristol Myers Squibb, Inc.) has now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM. Aficamten (Cytokinetics, Inc.) is the second in class cardiac myosin inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in ongoing phase III clinical trials, and is the subject of this review.},

abstract = {Objective: To review the current literature on the efficacy and safety of cardiac myosin inhibitors (CMIs) for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Data Sources: A literature search was conducted on PubMed from origin to April 2023, using the search terms “MYK-461,” “mavacamten,” “CK-3773274,” and “aficamten.” Studies were limited to English-based literature, human subjects, and clinical trials resulting in the inclusion of 13 articles. ClinicalTrials.gov was also used with the same search terms for ongoing and completed trials. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Only phase II and III studies were included in this review except for pharmacokinetic studies that were used to describe drug properties. Data Synthesis: CMIs enable cardiac muscle relaxation by decreasing the number of myosin heads that can bind to actin and form cross-bridges. Mavacamten, the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug in this class, has been shown to improve hemodynamic, functional, and quality of life measures in HCM with obstruction. In addition, aficamten is likely to become the next FDA-approved CMI with promising phase II data and an ongoing phase III trial expected to release results in the next year. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice in Comparison with Existing Drugs: CMIs provide a novel option for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, particularly in those not suitable for septal reduction therapy. Utilization of these agents requires knowledge of drug interactions, dose titration schemes, and monitoring parameters for safety and efficacy. Conclusions: CMIs represent a new class of disease-specific drugs for treatment of HCM. Cost-effectiveness studies are needed to delineate the role of these agents in patient therapy.},

abstract = {Purpose
To examine the prognostic value of location-specific arterial calcification quantities at lung screening low-dose CT for the prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.


Materials and Methods
This retrospective study included 5564 participants who underwent low-dose CT from the National Lung Screening Trial between August 2002 and April 2004, who were followed until December 2009. A deep learning network was trained to quantify six types of vascular calcification: thoracic aorta calcification (TAC); aortic and mitral valve calcification; and coronary artery calcification (CAC) of the left main, the left anterior descending, and the right coronary artery. TAC and CAC were determined in six evenly distributed slabs spatially aligned among chest CT images. CVD mortality prediction was performed with multivariable logistic regression using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The methods were compared with semiautomatic baseline prediction using self-reported participant characteristics, such as age, history of smoking, and history of illness. Statistical significance between the prediction models was tested using the nonparametric DeLong test.


Results
The prediction model was trained with data from 4451 participants (median age, 61 years; 37.9% women) and then tested on data from 1113 participants (median age, 61 years; 37.9% women). The prediction model using calcium scores achieved a C statistic of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.79), and it outperformed the baseline model using only participant characteristics (C statistic, 0.69; P = .049). Best results were obtained when combining all variables (C statistic, 0.76; P < .001).


Conclusion
Five-year CVD mortality prediction using automatically extracted image-based features is feasible at lung screening low-dose CT.© RSNA, 2021.},

abstract = {La cardiomiopatía hipertrófica es una entidad de origen genético que se caracteriza por hipertrofia ventricular izquierda en ausencia de otras enfermedades como etiología. Los pacientes suelen ser asintomáticos; sin embargo, el espectro de presentación es amplio pudiéndose encontrar falla cardiaca, obstrucción del tracto de salida, arritmias, muerte súbita y la etapa final o ''burnout''. La valoración morfológica inicial se realiza con ecocardiograma transtorácico, aunque la resonancia magnética cardiaca es el estudio de elección para confirmar el diagnóstico. Presentamos el caso de una mujer de 43 años con antecedente de cardiomiopatía hipertrófica quien había sido intervenida previamente e ingresó al servicio de urgencias de forma descompensada, documentándose progresión a fase “burnout” y su manejo subsecuente. Si bien este fenotipo no es común tiene importantes implicaciones pronósticas y en la calidad de vida. Por lo anterior, un diagnóstico y tratamiento oportuno pueden impactar favorablemente.},
